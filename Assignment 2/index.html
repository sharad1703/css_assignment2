        <div class="v1">
            <p>When you try your best, but you don't succeed<br>
                When you get what you want, but not what you need<br>
                When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep<br>
                Stuck in reverse <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="v2">
            <p>And the tears come streaming down your face  <br>
                When you lose something you can't replace<br>
                When you love someone, but it goes to waste<br>
                Could it be worse? <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="v3">
            <p>Lights will guide you home  <br>
                And ignite your bones<br>
                And I will try to fix you<br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="v4">
            <p>And high up above, or down below         <br>
                When you're too in love to let it go<br>
                But if you never try, you'll never know<br>
                Just what you're worth <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="v5">
            <p>Lights will guide you home <br>
                And ignite your bones <br>
                And I will try to fix you <br>
